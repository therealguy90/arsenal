# Arsenal Bot

Arsenal is a Discord bot made with discord.js to connect to FoundryVTT worlds. (WIP)

## How does Arsenal work?

Arsenal works by literally logging in to a FoundryVTT world using a GM account via browser. Using a headless browser with no GUI, Arsenal directly injects macros to the browser console to execute commands.

## TO-DO LIST:

- [x] Allow multiple Discord servers to join a Foundry world, one for each server
- [x] Link a user to an Actor 
- [ ] Allow users to create custom commands for their system
- [ ] Make a way to export the commands to share their own private Arsenal
- [ ] Foundry to Discord integration for two-way Chat Mirroring
